Given an array of positive integers and many queries for divisibility. In every query Q[i], we are given an integer K , we need to count all elements in the array which are perfectly divisible by K.

Constraints:1<=T<=1001<=N,M<=1051<=A[i],Q[i]<=105


Input

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines. First line of each test case contains two integers N & M, second line contains N space separated array elements and third line contains M space separated queries.
