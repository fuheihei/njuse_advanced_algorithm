格子里的整数
Description

Given a square grid of size n, each cell of which contains integer cost which represents a cost to traverse through that cell, we need to find a path from top left cell to bottom right cell by which total cost incurred is minimum.

Note : It is assumed that negative cost cycles do not exist in input matrix.


Input

The first line of input will contain number of test cases T. Then T test cases follow . Each test case contains 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer n denoting the size of the grid. Next line of each test contains a single line containing N*N space separated integers depecting cost of respective cell from (0,0) to (n,n).

Constraints:1<=T<=50，1<= n<= 50


Output

For each test case output a single integer depecting the minimum cost to reach the destination.
