Description

Implement pow(A, B) % C.In other words, given A, B and C, find (A^B)%C


Input

The first line of input consists number of the test cases. The following T lines consist of 3 numbers each separated by a space and in the following order:A B C'A' being the base number, 'B' the exponent (power to the base number) and 'C' the modular.Constraints:1 ≤ T ≤ 70,1 ≤ A ≤ 10^5,1 ≤ B ≤ 10^5,1 ≤ C ≤ 10^5


Output

In each separate line print the modular exponent of the given numbers in the test case.
