Description

Given a Complete Binary tree, print the level order traversal in sorted order.


Input

The first line of the input contains integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line takes an integer n denoting the size of array i.e number of nodes followed by n-space separated integers denoting the nodes of the tree in level order fashion.(1<=T<=100；1<=n<=10^5）


Output

For each test case, the output is the level order sorted tree. ( Note: For every level, we only print distinct elements.)
