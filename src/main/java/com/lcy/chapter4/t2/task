矩阵计算
Description

Let's define a Series Whose recurrence formula is as follows :

C(n)= 3C(i-1) + 4C(i-2) + 5C(i-3) + 6C(i-4)

C(0)= 2

C(1)= 0

C(2)= 1

C(3)= 7

Now based on this Series a Matrix Mi,j of size nn is to be formed.The top left cell is(1,1) and the bottom right corner is (n,n). Each cell (i,j) of the Matrix contains either 1 or 0. If C( (i*j)^3 ) is odd, Mi,j is 1, otherwise, it's 0.Count the total number of ones in the Matrix.


Input

First Line Of the input will contain an integer 'T'- the number of test cases . Each of the next 'T' lines consists of an integer 'n'.-denoting the size of the matrix.

Constraints :

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000

1 ≤ n ≤ 1000


Output

For each test case, output a single Integer -the taste value fo the dish of size-n*n.
